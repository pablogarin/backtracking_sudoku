# Sudoku Solver

This is a showcase project.

To play sudoku just load the app.

Click on any free cell to fill it with the number you think should go.

Hoy Keys:
- SPACE: solve sudoku
- n: New sudoku

## Install

I recommend using a virtual environment to deploy this app to prevent dependency collisions.

`python3 -m venv venv`
`. source venv/bin/activate`

To install it's dependencies, just run `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
